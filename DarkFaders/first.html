			<h2 style="color:white">Lets talk about music <em>design</em> </h2>
			<p style="color:white">We usually start with 1 sound,like a note from a piano or from a synthesizer with 2 or more ocillator combine to create a sound, and then we build everythig else on that particular sound.<br> We could put a lot of effects and other modulation on it so its sound different.
				Also sometimes,when we say "we dont have any inspiration",we go and listen to various audio samples from other producers or composers that anyone can find on the internet,free and non-free. And then we create other sound or melodies from that audio sample that we here and like it. What im trying to say is that a music design is an ART. And in art there is no rules to what to do and how to do it,you could create something very cool with out to start it from scratch.
